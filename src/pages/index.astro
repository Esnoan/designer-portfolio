            Hi! I'm Camilo, a guy passionate about design, art and technology,
            with a colorful and diverse history that has deeply influenced my
            creative approach. Since my childhood, I've always been fascinated
            by drawing and creativity in all its forms. I think my love for
            design was born in those early years, drawing whenever I could in my
            notebooks and textbooks and creating imaginary worlds in my mind.
          </p>
          <p class='mt-10'>
            Born in Colombia, I grew up surrounded by a rich mix of cultures and
            traditions that have influenced my work. My journey in the
            professional world began when exploring
          </p>

      </div>
      <p class='mt-10'>
        The different professions in technology I discovered one that brought
        together everything I love, on one hand the creation of a product that
        impacts people's lives, and on the other hand my more creative approach,
        those two passions helped me to find UX/UI design. Since then, I have
        been in constant search of new ways of expression and how to merge
        functionality with aesthetics in every project I embark on.
      </p>
      <p class='mt-10'>
        My approach to design is based on the idea that every project tells a
        unique story, and I strive to capture the essence of that narrative in
        every creation by always using real data. I am inspired by nature,
        architecture and the people around me, and I seek to integrate these
        influences into my work in an organic and authentic way.
      </p>
      <p class='mt-10'>
        In my free time I love listening to music, going to the gym, I enjoy
        movies, movies and series in general, I love food, video games and much
        more.
