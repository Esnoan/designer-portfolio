      UX Case Study: Redesigning and Creating a Design System
    </h1>
    <Paragraph title='Context'>
      The platform I was working on needed a complete overhaul. Its design was
      outdated, the user experience was unintuitive and it lacked visual
      consistency. My goal was to modernise the interface, improve usability and
      create a scalable design system that optimised workflows and visual
      consistency.

        <li>The UI was outdated and did not follow modern trends.</li>

          A scalable solution was required to improve the efficiency of the
          design and development team.
