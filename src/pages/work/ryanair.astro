    <Paragraph title='Introduction'>
      Welcome to one of my favorite projects, and it is not only because I
      learned a lot while developing it, but also because thanks to this work I
      got a job offer, so let's talk a little bit about the main objectives and
      my approach.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph title='Objectives & Challenges'>
      The objective was basically to analyze from a UX perspective a search flow
      of Ryanair, a low cost airline group, very famous in Europe. Having as
      main challenges to propose at least 3 product improvements, and of course,
      the most important and exciting, to use the UX tools that best fit my
      context.
    </Paragraph>
    <img src='/images/ryanair/search.png' alt='' />
    <Paragraph title='Understand'>
      As an initial step, I concentrated on understanding the entire search
      flow, all its possible variants, and how these influenced the different
      results, obviously all this focused on finding weaknesses, where we could
      improve, as well as strengths to maintain.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph title='Pre-Study Findings and Lessons Learned'>
      The first finding I found was the lack of round-trip dates at the
      beginning of the flow. At first I was puzzled, and although later when
      filling in the initial fields the other fields emerge, I think it is
      something to keep in mind in the future of this research.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Another discovery I found was the fact that there is no section in the
      initial flow to add a class (Economy, premium, executive...) is something
      I have seen in other flight purchase platforms, in this case it would be
      extremely interesting to do a usability test in the future to know what
      other users think.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      A great idea came up: imagine if Ryanair incorporated a function that goes
      beyond, a functionality that is more than a plus, that makes a difference.
      Add the ability to book not only the flight, but also the accommodation.
      This feature would not only optimize the hotel rental experience, but
      would solve a major challenge faced by travelers, which is how to manage
      flights and accommodations.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Before starting with the research, and to complement the previous
      analysis, I decided to make a heuristic evaluation, this helped me a lot
      to find any usability problem that the flow may present. The evaluation
      was developed according to the functionality of the product, that is to
      say, without going deeper into the other elements than the search flow.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      I found that in general all the Nielsen rules are fulfilled, for example,
      rule #1 Visibility of the system state, which I feel is fundamental in
      this type of flows
    </Paragraph>

    <img src='/images/ryanair/filter.png' alt='' />

    <Paragraph>
      Rule #1 Visibility of the system status is fulfilled
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Among other things I found that one rule was broken, rule #3 Give the user
      control and freedom. After researching it, I realized that at a business
      level, it is necessary that some functionalities limit the user, so as not
      to hinder the general search flow.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph title='Research'>
      My objectives with this research are varied, but concrete: to test my
      initial assumptions seen above and at the same time eliminate any bias, on
      the other hand is to carry out a thorough evaluation of our competition.
      Why? To understand what our competitors do to solve the same problem we
      face, and to look for gaps and opportunities for improvement in order to
      create and achieve that valuable added value for our users.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph title='Method Definition:'>
      To validate my hypotheses and findings I will use a UX survey, having
      already a solid idea of where to start working, it was a pretty clear
      option. On the competitive analysis side, I will do a Benchmark, with the
      clear objective of collecting the best of the competition and see what
      they are doing wrong to improve it. To complement both, I will probably do
      some online research focused on reading comments from different
      communities to have a much broader and more solid spectrum.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph title='Quantitative Research: '>
      I am aware that it would have been better to do an open survey, but in my
      context and with the little time I had, the most efficient thing to do was
      to focus on doing a more closed survey with the specific purpose of
      finding out if my hypotheses are correct or not.
    </Paragraph>
    <img src='/images/ryanair/charts.png' alt='' />
    <Paragraph title='Key Information. The survey confirmed that: '>
      <span class='font-bold text-3xl mr-2'>&#x2022;</span>The majority of users
      would like to have the option of dates as soon as they enter the search
      flow.<br />
      <span class='font-bold text-3xl mr-2'>&#x2022;</span>The vast majority of
      respondents would like the initial flow to include the option to choose
      class. <br />
      <span class='font-bold text-3xl mr-2'>&#x2022;</span>The new functionality
      of bundling the hotel accommodation option with flights is quite
      interesting for the majority of potential users.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph title='Benchmarking'>
      As I mentioned before, we will use this research tool to analyze and
      understand how other companies in the industry solve this problem. I will
      use the platforms that have more comments and reviews to be able to work
      not only under my experience, but also under data, which are essential at
      all stages (design, testing, development and implementation).
    </Paragraph>
    <img src='/images/ryanair/logos.png' alt='' />
    <Paragraph title='Interesting findings and validations'>
      This research got me quite excited, as I found different improvements
      (already validated, and that are working) that I could add in a final
      wireframe, and at the same time I also managed to validate again my
      previous hypotheses.
    </Paragraph>
    <img src='/images/ryanair/despegar.png' alt='' />
    <Paragraph> https://www.despegar.com.co/ </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Analyzing Despegar search engine, when delving into its interface, I
      noticed something interesting, the option of dates and classes come from
      the beginning of the flow, which confirms our previous hypothesis. On the
      other hand, they have the Flight + Accommodation option, a functionality
      very loved by Despegar users from what I could see in some sites, so I
      thought this could be a great feature for Ryanair users.
    </Paragraph>
    <img src='/images/ryanair/lufthansa.png' alt='' />
    <Paragraph> https://www.lufthansa.com/co/es/homepage </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      According to my research, Lufthansa is one of Ryanair's direct
      competitors, they also have the date and class fields in the initial flow.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The vast majority of industry platforms that I have researched, welcome us
      with all the fields, it is an aspect that gives control to the user, and
      is extremely important (rule #3 of usability heuristics), So no doubt
      along with the option to add the accommodation with the flight, will be
      some of our star proposals.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph title='Usability Testing'>
      With the data I already had at that time would have been enough to start
      implementing and proposing new improvements for Ryanair's search flow,
      however, having already designed an interface I can afford the luxury of
      doing a usability test, in order to discover and find possible
      improvements, and undoubtedly complement my previous research, giving it a
      more open and qualitative approach.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      As I wanted the test to be more subjective and give me more personal
      information to complement what I already had, the goal was that my users
      performed the specific task of navigating through the search flow, and in
      the course of this go asking them about what they thought, if at any time
      something generated frustration, if it was easy or not to understand the
      navigation, in short analyze the Customer Journey, and try hand in hand
      with users to find possible improvements.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph title='A Great Finding'>
      I am very excited to say that, thanks to the usability test I was able to
      find a great improvement, that if I only did the closed survey I would
      have missed. At the beginning a problem arose, it was that users did not
      understand a part of the flow, specifically where you choose the airport,
      4 of the 5 users failed to understand the operation of this section, so
      the user was blocked and in some cases deviated from the flow.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph title='Solution'>
      When I understood the problem, and with the feedback and results of my
      test, I was thinking about the best way to find a solution to address my
      problem (taking into account my context). Then I remembered that in my
      previous competitive analysis there were several different options in the
      search and airports section, which I had at hand and could investigate, to
      extract the differences and present them to my users, to see if by chance
      any of them gave a solution to my problem (I feel it is important to "own"
      the problem, to feel it, both as a UX designer and as a user).
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      This is what some of my users had to say about the problem:
    </Paragraph>
    <img src='/images/ryanair/chat1.png' alt='' />
    <img src='/images/ryanair/chat2.png' alt='' />
    <Paragraph>
      I presented several interfaces, and the one that undoubtedly stood out the
      most among our users was the LATAM Airlines search bar. At no time did the
      users feel lost or blocked, so I quickly knew it was a winning feature,
      and one that I would definitely include in my list of proposals.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph title='Proposals List'>
      Throughout this exciting journey, full of discoveries and learnings thanks
      to all the analysis and research carried out, having known first hand what
      is the problem I am facing, I have enough clear and solid data to start
      making design proposals:
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      <span class='font-bold text-3xl mr-2'>&#x2022;</span>Add round-trip dates,
      or one-way dates if applicable, at the beginning of the flow (without the
      need to complete the above steps). <br />
      <span class='font-bold text-3xl mr-2'>&#x2022;</span>Add a section to
      select the class at the beginning of the flow. <br />
      <span class='font-bold text-3xl mr-2'>&#x2022;</span>Add a flights +
      accommodations option, combining both. <br />
      <span class='font-bold text-3xl mr-2'>&#x2022;</span>Make the search bar
      for the destination part, to be written, so that when typing the available
      options (countries, city and airport) are shown. In the same way, if the
      destination is not found, an alert modal will be displayed.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph title='Low Fidelity Sketch'>
      As the Ryanair interface already existed, we only asked for a low fidelity
      sketch with the new proposals applied, all according to the UX studio
      previously developed. This was the result:
    </Paragraph>
    <img src='/images/ryanair/propuestas.png' alt='' />

    <Paragraph title='What I Learn?'>
      I really like to review everything I learn when I finish a case study, I
      think this is very useful to be constantly improving, so the following are
      some of the most important learnings:
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      <span class='font-bold text-3xl mr-2'>&#x2022;</span>One of the previous
      knowledge that I applied in this case study was the fact of knowing how to
      adapt to the project in which I was working, this implies knowing what the
      tools are and how to apply them in our context. This really helped me to
      save a lot of time and in general to optimize the results I obtained in
      the whole case.<br />
      <span class='font-bold text-3xl mr-2'>&#x2022;</span>This is one of the
      cases in which I have participated where I have realized the great
      importance of user testing, which is fundamental among many other things
      to have real data to design.<br />
      <span class='font-bold text-3xl mr-2'>&#x2022;</span>It is always
      important to take a look at our competition, whether direct or indirect,
      as always to see which elements can inspire us to improve our product and
      which to avoid.<br />
