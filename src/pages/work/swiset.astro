      Swiset, building a design system with an approach to identity, usability
      and accessibility
    </h1>
    <Paragraph title='Introduction'>
      This was one of the most interesting projects for me, because apart from
      learning a lot about the design systems, it was also a very enriching
      experience in the sense of teamwork. In this case study I will share with
      you how we approached and built a design system.

    <Paragraph title='About'>
      As Swiset grew we realized that it was time to create a font of truth, a
      system that would provide us with elements, styles, components and all the
      patterns of the company, so that all the visual components of the brand
      would be coherent. Design systems are also useful to streamline the
      teamwork of large projects, to maintain a stable organization in all
      designs and much more.
