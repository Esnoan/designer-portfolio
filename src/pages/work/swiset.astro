      Swiset, building a design system with an approach to identity, usability
      and accessibility
    </h1>
    <Paragraph title='Introduction'>
      This was one of the most interesting projects for me, because apart from
      learning a lot about the design systems, it was also a very enriching
      experience in the sense of teamwork. In this case study I will share with
      you how we approached and built a design system.

    <Paragraph title='About'>
      As Swiset grew we realized that it was time to create a font of truth, a
      system that would provide us with elements, styles, components and all the
      patterns of the company, so that all the visual components of the brand
      would be coherent. Design systems are also useful to streamline the
      teamwork of large projects, to maintain a stable organization in all
      designs and much more.
    </Paragraph>

    <h2 class='text-3xl text-black'>Process</h2>

    <Paragraph title='🪪‍ Visual Identity'>
      The visual identity is extremely important when building a coherent design
      system, because it is this aspect that gives us the context. Swiset is a
      modern, institutional Fintech and wants to transmit seriousness and
      accessibility in its products, so these principles will guide us when
      designing.

    <Paragraph title='⚛ Atomic Design'>
      Breaking down the interface elements into smaller elements results in more
      scalability and consistency within our design system, and a much more
      efficient way of both creating our components and organizing them in the
      UI.

    <Paragraph title='🧱 Documentation'>
      It is time to present all the principles, components and variants that
      will make up our design system. Also in some cases there will be
      documentation on how to use, context, application forms and description.

    <Paragraph title='Grind System Layouts & Spacing'>
      to maintain consistency within our design system, we created a grid system

    <Paragraph title='Iconography'>
      We love this recognized repository, because at UX level it is quite solid,

      consistent and coherent environment.

    <Paragraph title='Radius & Shadow'>
      With these elements we finish the basis of our design system, the corner
      radius is essential to create components such as modals, pop ups,
      information blocks, buttons among many others, this element will give a
      better look and differentiate it from the background. The shadow is an
      equally important element, and helps us to create depth and
      differentiation between the element we want to show and the background.

    <Paragraph title='Components'>
      For the components, which is where we delve into all the other elements
      that make up the UI, we took into account several aspects, best practices
      creating different states in each component to improve the scalability of
      the project, using atomic design, taking into account all the most popular
      design patterns used in the industry, always maintaining consistency and
      visual coherence, understanding the context and the audience, among other
      aspects.

      Finally, some of the other components that make up the Swiset design

    <Paragraph title='What I Learn?'>
      In this project I have acquired a vast knowledge about design systems,
      from the basic concepts to more complex and fundamental aspects for their
      construction, scalability and implementation. Some of the general
      knowledge I learned were:
      <br />
      <ul class='list-disc list-inside marker:text-black font-myriad text-xl'>
        <li>
          Concepts which I had previously studied and put into practice in
          personal projects, such as components, design patterns, style guides,
          tokens, component libraries, documentation and iteration, variants and
          prototyping, among many other aspects were tested in depth and in full
          understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Teamwork was fundamental to achieve all the objectives of this
          project, I loved sharing and learning from all my team, thanks to all
          my team, with whom we had many feedback sessions where we iterated and
          scaled the project.
